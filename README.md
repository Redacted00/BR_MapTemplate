**What about the lighting on the map in the editor?**

The lighting itself in the game will be normal, but in the editor it will look like this. When creating your map, you can first remove the BP_WorldSetupActor and put the usual lighting, then before preparing the map, remove all lighting and put back the BP_WorldSetupActor

**On the map in the game, I cannot change the time and weather. What to do?**

This is a bug. You can enter the editor by holding the O button and then exit. The bug will disappear.

**There are no interactive widgets near the editors so that you can enter it. Is this a bug?**

Yes

**How do I change my map information?**

Go to the folder with your map and open the LevelInfo file. In this file you can specify the name of your map and the icon.
